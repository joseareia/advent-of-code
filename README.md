Welcome to my repository of solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges across various years.

Currently, I'm tackling the 2024 and 2015 challenges simultaneously, experimenting with different programming languages for each year. For the 2024 challenges, I’m using [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) and potentially [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) as the days progress. For the 2015 challenges, I’m working with [Python](https://www.python.org/) only.

Each solution is accompanied by detailed comments that document my thought process as I work through the problem-solving journey. These insights may help others understand my approach or inspire new techniques!

Feel free to explore the code and follow my progress as I continue to take on new challenges each year.

## Progress
The table below shows my progress for each year:

| Year | Language | Stars Earned |
| :--: | :------: | :----------: |
| 2015 | Python   | 08/50        |
| 2024 | Perl     | 46/50        |

The progress table was inspired by [@anamsmartins](https://github.com/anamsmartins) :heart:

## Input Files
The input files for my solutions are stored in each day's folder. However, all my solutions are designed to work with any valid inputs. Feel free to grab your own inputs from the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website and try them out!
