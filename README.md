Welcome to my repository of solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges across various years.

I am currently revisiting challenges from previous years, experimenting with different programming languages for each year. At the moment, I am working on the challenges from 2015 and 2025 using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) exclusively. You can check the [Progress](https://github.com/joseareia/advent-of-code?tab=readme-ov-file#progress) tab to see the progress I have made in each year I’ve tackled or am currently tackling.

Each solution is accompanied by detailed comments that document my thought process as I work through the problem-solving journey. These insights may help others understand my approach or inspire new techniques!

Feel free to explore the code and follow my progress as I continue to take on new challenges each year.

## Progress
The table below shows my progress for each year:

| Year | Language | Stars Earned |
| :--: | :------: | :----------: |
| 2015 | Python   | 16/50        |
| 2024 | Perl     | 50/50        |
| 2025 | Lua      | 02/24        |

## Input Files
The input files for my solutions are stored in each day's folder. However, all my solutions are designed to work with any valid inputs. Feel free to grab your own inputs from the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website and try them out!
